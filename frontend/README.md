# Legacy Frontend Workspace

This directory contains the previous standalone Vite workspace. The active frontend now lives in the repository root under `src/` and is served by the root-level Vite configuration.

Use the root `npm run dev` script for local development. New UI work should be added to the root `src/` tree instead of this directory.

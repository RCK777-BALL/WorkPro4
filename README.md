## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 8+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Development Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd workpro-cmms
pnpm install
```

2. **Choose your MongoDB connection strategy:**

   - **Option A – Standalone or single-node MongoDB (default):** Ensure a MongoDB instance is listening on `localhost:27017` (via Homebrew, Chocolatey, Docker Desktop, etc.). No replica-set configuration is required because the default `DATABASE_URL` uses `directConnection=true`.
   - **Option B – Local replica set (Docker Compose or manual setup):** If you need replica-set behaviour, update `DATABASE_URL` to include `?replicaSet=rs0` and start the bundled services:
     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```
     The `mongodb-init` helper waits for MongoDB to become healthy and executes `rs.initiate(...)` so Prisma can connect immediately. You can achieve the same effect manually by starting `mongod --replSet rs0` and running `mongosh --eval 'rs.initiate(...)'` once.
   - **Option C – MongoDB Atlas or another managed cluster:** Paste the SRV/standard URI provided by your cloud provider into `DATABASE_URL` and ensure networking, TLS, and credentials are configured.

3. **Set up the database:**
```bash
# Copy environment file
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Push the Prisma schema to MongoDB
pnpm --filter backend db:push


# (Optional) Seed with full demo data
pnpm --filter backend db:seed
```

> ℹ️ The backend automatically bootstraps a demo tenant and users on startup if the database is empty. You can log in with the
> following credentials immediately after running the server:
>
> - `admin@demo.com / Password123`
> - `planner@demo.com / Password123`
> - `tech@demo.com / Password123`

The backend reads its MongoDB connection string from the `DATABASE_URL` value in `backend/.env`. Copying the example file seeds it with the standalone URI (`mongodb://localhost:27017/workpro4?directConnection=true`), which works for single-node development without replica sets. Adjust the URI if you're using the replica-set or managed-cluster strategies described above.

Set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` in `backend/.env` to the fully qualified origin (scheme + host + port) that should be allowed by CORS in production. When the variable is omitted the backend falls back to the local development origin (`http://localhost:5173`).

4. **Configure the frontend API base URL:**
```bash
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5010/api" > frontend/.env
```

This file is consumed by both the Vite dev server and production build so the frontend consistently points at the same API base URL. After adding or updating environment variables, restart any running `pnpm dev`/`pnpm dev:all` process to reload Vite with the new values.

5. **Start development servers:**
```bash
pnpm dev:all
```

This starts both the backend server (localhost:5010) and frontend app (localhost:5173). To run only the frontend, use `pnpm dev`.

The API exposes a lightweight readiness probe at `http://localhost:5010/api/health` and a database-specific check at `http://localhost:5010/health/db`.


### Production Build
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm --filter backend build
```

## 📊 Database Schema

The system uses MongoDB with Prisma's MongoDB connector. The schema lives in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and maps directly to the document structures stored in your database. Key collections include:

- **Tenants** - Multi-tenant isolation with per-tenant relationships across the data model
- **Users** - Authentication, role management, and audit authorship tracking
- **Assets** - Equipment hierarchy and maintenance history
- **WorkOrders** - Maintenance requests and execution tracking with creator references
- **DowntimeLogs** - Time-stamped downtime spans used to calculate uptime KPIs
- **Parts** - Inventory levels with vendor relationships and stockout tracking
- **PMTasks** - Preventive maintenance scheduling rules and generated tasks
- **PurchaseOrders** - Procurement workflow and approvals
- **AuditLogs** - Complete activity trail for compliance

### Dashboard Metrics & Extensibility

The premium dashboard aggregates KPI and chart data from `/api/dashboard/metrics`. The handler applies tenant- and role-aware filters and returns a normalized payload:

- **KPI suite** – Open work orders (with priority mix & Δ), MTTR, asset uptime, and stockout risk details
- **Visual panels** – Stacked status/priority analysis, top downtime assets, and a 14-day PM calendar
- **Context** – Echoes active filters (`siteId`, `lineId`, `assetId`, and date range) for URL persistence

To add a new metric:

1. Extend the Prisma schema or leverage existing collections with efficient indexes
2. Create an async loader alongside the existing helpers in `backend/src/routes/dashboard.ts`
3. Append the result to the `responsePayload` while respecting technician visibility rules
4. Update the React page (e.g. add a new `KpiCard` or chart component) and wire it through the `useDashboardMetrics` hook

Seed realistic data for demos using `pnpm --filter backend db:seed:demo`. The script populates ~200 assets, 2k work orders, downtime logs, and inventory so the dashboard instantly showcases trends. Use this dataset for Lighthouse/QA runs before layering in custom tenants.

### Environment Variables
Key environment variables for production:

```bash
# Database (choose the URI that matches your deployment)
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/workpro?directConnection=true"
# DATABASE_URL="mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/workpro?replicaSet=rs0"
# DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster-host/workpro?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Auth
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="your-refresh-secret"

# Redis
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# File Storage
S3_BUCKET="workpro-files"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"
```

## 📈 Performance

- **Database indexing** - Optimized queries for large datasets
- **Caching strategy** - Redis for session and API caching
- **Background jobs** - BullMQ for heavy operations
- **API rate limiting** - Protection against abuse
- **CDN ready** - Static asset optimization

## 🧑‍💻 Frontend workflow

- Start the Vite dev server: `pnpm dev` (frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`).
- Launch the Express API: `pnpm --filter backend dev` (API runs on `http://localhost:5010`).
- For production builds run `pnpm build` and `pnpm preview` to verify the optimized bundle.

### Extending the design system

1. **Add a brand color**
   - Update `src/styles/tokens.css` with a new OKLCH variable (for example `--brand-3`).
   - Map that variable inside `tailwind.config.ts` under `theme.extend.colors` to generate Tailwind utilities.
   - Use the generated utility class (e.g. `bg-brand-3`) or reference the CSS variable directly in components.
2. **Create a new status badge**
   - Add a new entry to `variants` in `src/components/premium/DataBadge.tsx` with background/text classes.
   - Render the badge anywhere by calling `<DataBadge status="your-status" />`.
